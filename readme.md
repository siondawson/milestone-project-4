![multi device mockup](testing/absolute-zero-multi-device-mockup.png)

## Purpose

This website was created for Code Institue's Milestone Project 4 assignment. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate an understanding of full stack web development with the creating of a Django app, which will include fully automated e-commerce functioniality. A full list of technologies used can be found in the technologies section fo this readme.

The live website can be found [here](https://absolute-zero-viola-quartet-0449ad0ad766.herokuapp.com/)

## Absolute Zero Viola Quartet Responsive Website

For this project I have chosen to understake a full redesign of Absolute Zero Viola Quartet's website. Their current website is built with wordpress by one of the band memebers who is not a web developer.

This project will cater to two distinct sets of users needs.

1) Sheetmusic Store:
* To sell their viola quartet arrangements via a fully automated e-commerce store.
2) Web presence for the band:
* Advertise upcoming concerts.
* Promote the band to promoters and concert organisers.
* Information about the band and its musicians.


## Web store

Absolute Zero Viola Quartet create their own arrangements of popular classical pieces. Their current website has a functioning sheet music store where users may select and buy sheet music, with one major issue: once paid for users must wait for a member of the band to email their purchases to them in the form of a pdf file. My redesign will generally improve the webstore user experience and add one key feature:

Once users have paid for an arragement it will be available for them to download. If a user loses the pdf, they may log back in to the website and download again.

The webstore was largely created by following code institutes 'Boutique Ado' project. This was modfied to suit the needs of Absolute Zero.

## Web presence for the band

# Structure

## Band App

An app for all content for the band itself: info, videos, concert listings, biographies.

### Index Page (Home)

Immidately below this is an iframe with a embedded youtube video that users may play to know what the band looks and sounds like. Below the video is a sub heading informing users of when the band was formed and a paragraph with some initial information on the band. 

This fulfils users stores:

The user is presented with a some short text about the origin of the and button leading them to the 'about' page where they may learn more about the band and its members.

Below is another sub heading before bootstrap cards present the user with a list of the bands upcoming performances. Each card is populated via the database and contains basic information on each performance: date, time, venue, city/towm and a ticket link. As most venue handle ticket sales internally or via an external ticket source a link is provided to the user.

In addition superusers may edit or delete concert listings via the concert listing bootstrap cards themselves. Appropriately colored 'Edit' and 'Delete' buttons are provided so the superuser may easily edit or delete concert listings.

The contact form has been designed with a general purpose in mind so all users who wish to send a message can use it, wether they are making a performance enquiry or enquiring about an order or have another question. 

As an page which requires more styling that other purely functional forms, I chose to use a similar styling to my milestone-project-1 contact form. An image of one of the band members was used as a background to entice users to send an enquiry.

The users name, email address a message are required by the form. The user may also leave their contact number in an optional field.

This is a function that a superuser must use only if they must as deleting sheetmusic from store also removed a users ability to access and download the deleted sheetmusic from their order history. This can be commuicated to anyone with superuser credentials. Sheetmusic rarely will need to be deleted as once it is placed for sale it likely will remain on sale.

As all sheetmusic products in the store include a score and set of parts as one single PDF file, it is assumed that a quantity of 1 serves a whole band of however many instruments the sheetmusic purchased is designed for.

This simply redirects users to the login page where they may login or create an account if they do not allready have one. Anonomous purchases would make downloading sheetmusic difficult after navigating away from their order confrimation. 

The checkout app to handles payments of sheetmusic items the user has selected. The user is brough to the 'checkout.html' page after clicking the relevant link in 'basket.html'. The user is presented with an order summary, so they may double check the order they are placing is correct. The user is also presented with a a series of forms where they may enter their :

A note on sheetmusic pdfs for CI submission: after setting up static file hosting on cloudinary, I discovered that their free plan does not allow for downloading of pdf files. It does however allow download of image files. So for submission all files in the sheetmusic 'pdf_file' field have been replaced with the same image used for the sheetmusic image. At this time cloudinary's paid subscrition is too expensive to for me to justify. The functionality remains the same.

All auth has a series of html templates with pre builtfunctionality. There were modifed to be in keeping of the style of the site. As there are many templates associated with allauth. Some styling was added on an ongoing basis. Some testing screenshots show unstyled buttons. These were corrected as I went, rather than pushing to github and deploying on heroku again.

# Wireframes

Wireframes can be found [here](https://github.com/siondawson/milestone-project-4/tree/main/wireframes).

Most pages have wireframes created for mobile and desktop and can be viewed via the link above.

Wireframes were not created for pages that are forms. Crispy forms was used to automatcially generate form fields. Each form was set to an appropiate width to suit the screen size and users expectation.


# Validation

## Python Linter

All python files were checked with the code institue python linter. Three line too long issues were left in place in webhook_handler.py for personal ease of reading as lines were only 1 character too long.

All other other files pass linting with no issues. Screen shots are available in this projects repository.
