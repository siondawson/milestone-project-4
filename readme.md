# Milestone Project 4 - Absolute Zero Viola Quartet

## Purpose

This website was created for Code Institue's Milestone Project 4 assignment. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate an understanding of full stack web development with the creating of a Django app, which will include fully automated e-commerce functioniality. A full list of technologies used can be found in the technologies section fo this readme.

## Absolute Zero Viola Quartet Responsive Website

For this project I have chosen to understake a full redesign of Absolute Zero Viola Quartet's website. Their current website is built with wordpress by one of the band memebers who is not a web developer. The main aspects of this project will cater to a variety of users to suit the bands needs including:

* Advertise upcoming concerts.
* Promote the band to promoters and concert organisers.
* Sell their viola quartet arrangements via a fully automated e-commerce store.

## Web store

Absolute Zero Viola Quartet create their own arrangements of popular public domain classical pieces. Their current website has a functioning sheet music store where users may select and buy sheet music, with one major issue: once paid for users must wait for a member of the band to email their purchases to them in the form of a pdf file. My redesign will generally improve the webstore user experience and add one key feature:

Once users have paid for an arragement it will be available for them to download. If a user loses the pdf, they may log back in to the website and download again.

# Apps

## Band App

An app for all content for the band itself: info, videos, concert listings, biographies.
